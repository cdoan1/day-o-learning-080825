# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an **Agentic AI research and development hackathon project** focused on capturing the collaborative effort between a developer and an agentic system. The project is in its early stages, documenting progress from zero.

## Project Goals

- Capture effort of 1 developer + 1 agentic system working together
- Starting from zero, record development progress
- Use agentic workflow throughout development

## Planned Implementation

The project plan includes:

1. **Bootstrap Project Setup**
   - Deploy a tier 3 cluster
   - Set up Regional management for tier 3
   - Configure MCE (Multicluster Engine) on tier 3
   - Deploy cert-manager on tier 3

2. **Maestro Communication Demo**
   - Demonstrate maestro communication between two ROSA HCP clusters

## Repository Structure

Currently a minimal repository with:
- `README.md` - Project overview and goals
- `LICENSE` - Apache License 2.0
- This is an early-stage project with infrastructure and tooling to be added

## Development Notes

- Project is in initial planning/setup phase
- No specific build tools, frameworks, or development commands yet established
- Timeline shows focused development blocks starting from 8AM
- Repository will likely evolve significantly as the project develops

## Future Development

As this project grows, expect addition of:
- Infrastructure as Code files
- Kubernetes/OpenShift configurations
- CI/CD pipelines
- Additional documentation and tooling
